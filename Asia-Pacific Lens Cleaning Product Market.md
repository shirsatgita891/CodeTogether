This segment includes various cleaning products like lens wipes, sprays, microfiber cloths, and cleaning solutions that help keep glasses free from smudges, dust, and dirt. As the global population ages and the demand for prescription eyewear increases, especially in countries like China, India, and Japan, the market for glasses care is expected to grow even further. Additionally, there is an increased focus on the comfort and clarity of eyewear, pushing manufacturers to produce specialized lens care products that ensure a scratch-free and clear viewing experience. As people are becoming more conscious of hygiene and the maintenance of their personal items, including their glasses, the market for cleaning products designed specifically for eyewear continues to expand.<p>The demand for glasses care products in the Asia-Pacific region is also bolstered by the trend of people using multiple pairs of glasses, such as prescription glasses and sunglasses, further driving the need for specialized cleaning solutions. Given the high density of eyewear consumers in countries like China, South Korea, and India, the glasses care subsegment is poised for strong growth.
